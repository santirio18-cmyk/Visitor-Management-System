## 🔑 User ID Information

### Database User ID

The **User ID** is automatically generated by the database when the account is created. It's the primary key (`id`) in the `users` table.

**To find Bharat's User ID:**

1. **After backend deployment**, the account will be created automatically
2. **User ID** will be assigned by SQLite (auto-incrementing integer)
3. **Email** is the unique identifier: `bharath.chandrasekaran@tvs.in`

### How to Get User ID

**Option 1: Check Backend Logs**
After deployment, check backend logs for:
```
✓ Created: Bharath Chandrasekaran
  Email: bharath.chandrasekaran@tvs.in
  Role: third_level_approver
```

**Option 2: Query Database**
```sql
SELECT id, name, email, role FROM users WHERE email = 'bharath.chandrasekaran@tvs.in';
```

**Option 3: API Call (After Login)**
1. Login with Bharat's credentials
2. The JWT token will contain the user ID
3. Or check the `/api/users` endpoint (if you have manager access)

curl -X POST https://carbon-theorem-474515-b2.et.r.appspot.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"jagadeeshan.jayaseelan@tvs.in","password":"J@ga2024#TVS!Warehouse"}'

# Get users list (use token from login)
curl https://carbon-theorem-474515-b2.et.r.appspot.com/api/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Via Database:
If you have database access:
```sql
SELECT id, name, email, role, created_at 
FROM users 
WHERE email = 'bharath.chandrasekaran@tvs.in';
```
