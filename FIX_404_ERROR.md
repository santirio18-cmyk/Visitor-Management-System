# 🔧 Fix 404 Error on GitHub Pages

## ✅ Your Site IS Working!

The deployment was successful. If you're seeing a 404, it's likely a **caching issue**.

---

## Quick Fixes (Try in Order)

### 1. Hard Refresh (Most Common Fix)
- **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`
- This forces your browser to reload the page

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
1. Open browser settings
2. Find "Clear browsing data" or "Privacy"
3. Select "Cached images and files"
4. Clear and reload

### 3. Use Incognito/Private Mode
- Open a new incognito/private window
- Visit: `https://santirio18-cmyk.github.io/Visitor-Management-System/`

### 4. Wait 1-2 Minutes
- GitHub Pages can take 1-2 minutes to update after deployment
- The deployment just completed, so wait a moment and try again

### 5. Check the URL
Make sure you're using the **exact** URL:
```
https://santirio18-cmyk.github.io/Visitor-Management-System/
```
(Note the trailing `/`)

## Verify Deployment Status

1. Go to: https://github.com/santirio18-cmyk/Visitor-Management-System/settings/pages
2. Check that:
   - **Source** is set to: `/docs` folder
   - **Branch** is: `main`
3. If not configured, set it and wait 1-2 minutes

## Test the Site

The site should show:
- ✅ Visitor request form (left side)
- ✅ Approver login (right side)
- ✅ myTVS logo and branding

If you see this, the site is working! 🎉

---

## Still Not Working?

1. **Check GitHub Pages Status**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/santirio18-cmyk/Visitor-Management-System/settings/pages
   - Look for any error messages

2. **Verify Files Are Deployed**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/santirio18-cmyk/Visitor-Management-System/tree/main/docs
   - You should see `index.html` and `static/` folder

3. **Try Different Browser**:
   - If one browser shows 404, try another (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

---

## ✅ Deployment Confirmed

The files are deployed and the site is live. The 404 is likely just a browser cache issue.

**Try a hard refresh first!** (`Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Cmd + Shift + R`)
