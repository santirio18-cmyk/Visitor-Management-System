# ✅ Easy Way - Add JWT_SECRET to app.yaml

## I've Already Added It!

The `JWT_SECRET` is now in your `app.yaml` file.

---

## Just Redeploy:

In Cloud Shell, run:

```bash
cd Visitor-Management-System/server/Visitor-Management-System/server
git pull
gcloud app deploy
```

Type `Y` when asked.

Wait 3-5 minutes - Done! ✅

## That's It!

After redeploy, your backend will have the JWT_SECRET set automatically!
